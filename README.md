## Requirements
If you do not intend to work with the template source code (and that means you will not be compiling it), you do not need to install anything. You can simply navigate to the public folder and take the HTML snippets directly from there.

Most developers will be editing the source code and will also recompile the template files. If that's the case, then ensure that you have Node.js installed. [You can download it from here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

If you are going to customise the template or add new pages, you need to familiar with Pug, the template engine used. [You can read more about Pug here](https://pugjs.org/)

## Quick Start
Project's source files are placed in ./src/ directory. 
* ./src/assets - default static files (eg. image placeholders). You should replace them with your own files.
* ./src/tailwind/ - Tailwind config file used to build the theme.

All your pages (templates) are stored in separated .pug files
* ./src/pug/*.pug  

NOTE: npm commands overwrite the ./public directory.

```
# Install dependencies
